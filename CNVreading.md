## 1. Why is important to construct a CNV map on health individuals of various ethnicities?
- because the CNV patterns differ among ethnicities. "normal" depends on the ethnological context.

## 2. What is the CNV size that the authors defined? 
Noted: The NV size definition is still under debate and may be different in other literature
- 50 bp to 3 Mb

## 3. What are the primary approaches used for CNV detection? And what are the advantages and limitations of these technologies? (CNV discoveries)
- microarrays
  - The first studies to assay CNVs primarily used micro- arrays with large-insert clones (known as bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs))7 and oligonucleotide arrays8. Subsequent microarrays have included both comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)9,10,14,41 and SNP-based arrays.
  - suited for quantitative variants
  - deletions easyer to identify
  - limited resolution (max. 450bp)
- NGS
  - calls smaller variants and is biased towards the detection of deletions
  - high sensitivity
  - ccurate sequence-level breakpoint resolution
- Currently, no single discovery strategy can cap- ture the entire spectrum of structural variations in the genome

4. The authors used clustering method to combine data from different studies into merged
CNVRs (Copy number variable regions). What are the two criteria for cluster filtering? And
why did they do this filtering? (The CNV map)

5.What are thresholds in stringency level 1, inclusive map (stringency level 2), and stringent
map (stringency level 12) respectively? (The CNV map)

6. Which percentage of the genome contributes to CNV in inclusive map and stringent map
respectively? (Properties of the CNV map)

7. By your intuition, which kind of genes are more variable between protein-coding genes and
non-coding genes? How about their findings in this paper? (Functional impact of CNV)

8. The authors generated a null CNV map and found genes for which at least 85% of the
exons were homozygous deleted. What are the functions of these genes? And why did the
authors sav that they seem to be non-essential? (Homozygous deleted genes)

9. If you are a medical doctor, how do you use this map as a tool to assess the clinical
importance of a CNV? (Clinical application of the CNV map part in Discussion)
