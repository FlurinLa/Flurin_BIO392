# day 3 

- UCSC genome browser https://genome-euro.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg38&lastVirtModeType=default&lastVirtModeExtraState=&virtModeType=default&virtMode=0&nonVirtPosition=&position=chrX%3A15560138%2D15602945&hgsid=290662285_Fb1M2aMP5aCk8N4Foq8zPwovXDPC
  - genome vs. conservation, exons, .. -> find spots which likely contain lots of information.
  - data representation is "boring plain text"
  - 3bio bo/human genome
  - variant data store logic: chrom, start, end (of variant, duplication, ..?)
    - discussed storage formats: only reference genoma, FASTA and one other (FASTQ?) sequence based
  - sequencing: degree of uncertainty for each nucleotide
  - naming of reference genomes is a mess
  - "if youre doing science and youre using a mouse: this is not reproducible"
  
## terminal, UNIX
- philosophy: small efficient programs which only do one thing
- write skripts which connect these programs
  - without saving to disk, compi can process files (text string processing)


date > folder/file.txt
> writes current date into new text file

- "shebang": #!\"language in which skript was written"
- file extensions can be anything, not bound to what language stuff is written!

- shell -> kernel -> computer ressources![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103630748/191703178-b083d6e2-3603-4d3a-8e9f-7d4b4087587c.png)

- prompt = symbol at beginning of commandline which indicates that compi is ready to take command (UNIX: $)
