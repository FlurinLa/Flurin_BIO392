# notes on the paper "The Progenetix oncogenomic resource in 2021"
[paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/database/baab043)  

## questions to answer:

### What is CNV/CNA?
* CNV = copy number variations
* CNA = copy number aberrations
terms are used interchangeably to describe aberrant numbers of copies of one gene (one locus) with respect to a reference genome.

### How will you describe or introduce progenetix (scale, data source, cancer types and so on)? 
* Progenetix is a publicly accessible cancer genome data resource [progenetix](progenetix.org) that aims to provide a comprehensive representation of genomic variation profiles in cancer, through providing sample-specific CNA profiles and associated metadata as well as services related to data annotation, meta-analysis and visualization.
* The Progenetix resource provides an extensive collection of oncogenomic data with a focus on individual genome-wide CNA profiles and the use of modern ontologies and data schemas to render curated biological and technical meta- data, as well as thorough references to external repositories and annotation resources.
* includes 138 663 CNV profiles, as well as information on the geographic origin of the sample, the predicted ancestry of the patient, the cancer type and and different classification methods


### Describe NCIt, ICOD, UBERON codes, and their relationships.

### What are CNV segmentations and CNV frequencies, and how to use them? What are APIs and how to use APIs in progenetix?


### How does progenetix visualise CNA profiles?


### What do you think should be improved in progenetix?
