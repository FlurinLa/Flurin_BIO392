## NGS technologies

next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies = large-scale DNA sequencing technology that allows for querying the entire genome (whole genome), the exons within all known genes (whole exome), or only exons of selected genes (target panel). 
in contrast to sanger sequencing, NGS does not rely on primers.

## molecular cytogenetig techniques
### bandinng analysis
- allows each chromosome to be identified by its characteristic banding pattern
- in general, the dark bands have a lower G-C content than the interbands, where genes tend to be located

### SNP arrays
- single nucleotide polymorphisms are single base mutations that are estabilhed in the genepoll of a population 
- SNP arrays check for SNPs at specific loci
- these arrays are widely used in diagnostics and in forensics, as they provide relatively quick and cheap, yet accurate information

### aCGH
- Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is a molecular cytogenetic technique that enables the genome-wide analysis of DNA copy numbers
- Array CGH involves cohybridizing a test (patient) DNA sample and a control (reference) DNA sample, each differentially labeled with different colored fluorescent dyes (usually red and green, respectively), to a microarray slide containing thousands of DNA probes (oligos) that cover the entire human genome.
