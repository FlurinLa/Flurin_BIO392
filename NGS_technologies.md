## NGS technologies

next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies = large-scale DNA sequencing technology that allows for querying the entire genome (whole genome), the exons within all known genes (whole exome), or only exons of selected genes (target panel). 
in contrast to sanger sequencing, NGS does not rely on primers.

## molecular cytogenetig techniques
### bandinng analysis
- allows each chromosome to be identified by its characteristic banding pattern
- in general, the dark bands have a lower G-C content than the interbands, where genes tend to be located
